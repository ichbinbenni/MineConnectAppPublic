**MineConnect** is an app for ios and a plugin that allows you to monitor and interact with your Minecraft server from everywhere using your smartphone.  
This is an early version. We plan to listen to your feedback, so we can build a nice and useful App together.  
On this site you can share your [feedback and report bugs](https://github.com/ichbinbenni/MineConnectAppPublic/issues). Just open an issue and tag your category. Like bug or feature request.

## Setup

### Installation

#### 1. Plugin

Download the plugin from our [website](https://mineconnect.de/versions.html).

Just drag & drop the plugin file into your plugins folder. MineConnect needs Port 4711 - so make sure the port is open. You can change the port with the command ```/setPort number```.


#### 2. App
Download the app from the [Apple AppStoreÂ®](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mineconnect/id1507676445) or for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.coloniapp.mineconnect).

To add a new server you need to join your server in Minecraft. Execute the command ```/registerMe```. This will give you a four-digit one time password. So you don't need to remember it. Enter this password with the server address and your username into the MineConnect app.

Still need help? Visit the [help page](help.md).

### Features

#### For users
- Push notifications for join-, leave-, die- and message- events. You can select each user you want to get a notification for.
- Push notifications when the server starts or the server shuts down.
- Push notification if a new player joined the game.
- Chat with your server and friends from the MineConnect app. Even private conversations from Minecraft are as simple as using the ```/tell <Player> <Message>```-command.
- Dashboard that shows you what is interesting for you. How many persons are playing, who is online and other stats.
- Statistics
- Dynmap. If dynmap is installed you can see it directly from within the app.

#### For admins
- Execute commands from the app. Also save your favorite commands for quick access.
- Access to the console.
- You can adjust everything easy from the app - no property file or commands you have to learn.
- White/Blacklist support: MineConnect can only be used by users that are on your whitelist (if enabled) or not on your blacklist.
- All operators are also admins for MineConnect.
- Use ```/setPort 4711``` to change the port from inside Minecraft.

### Support
It costs $99 a year to publish an app to the AppStore. The app is free and without ads. It would be nice if you support this project and help me not to pay for making this app.
